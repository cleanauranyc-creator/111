# Image Organization Guide

This folder contains all images for the Clean Aura website. Replace placeholder images with your real photos.

## Folder Structure

### `/before-after/`
Before and after photos of your cleaning work. These are used in the interactive slider on the homepage.

**Current placeholders to replace:**
- `kitchen-before.jpg` & `kitchen-after.jpg`
- `bathroom-before.jpg` & `bathroom-after.jpg`
- `living-room-before.jpg` & `living-room-after.jpg`

**Tips for great before/after photos:**
- Take photos from the exact same angle
- Use similar lighting
- Show dramatic transformations
- High resolution (at least 1920x1440px)

### `/team/` (create this folder when ready)
Photos of your cleaning team members for the "Meet Our Team" section.

### `/testimonials/` (create this folder when ready)
Customer photos to accompany testimonials (with permission).

### `/services/` (create this folder when ready)
Photos showcasing specific services (deep cleaning, move-in/out, etc.).

## How to Replace Images

1. **Keep the same filename** - This ensures the website continues to work without code changes
2. **Maintain aspect ratio** - Before/after images work best at 4:3 ratio
3. **Optimize file size** - Use tools like TinyPNG to compress images without losing quality
4. **Use JPG format** - For photos, JPG is best. PNG for logos/graphics.
